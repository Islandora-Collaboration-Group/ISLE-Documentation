## Test ISLE

The recommended non-production environments for using the prebuilt ISLE test site (`isle.localdomain`) are with the following type of laptops or workstations.

Please review the [ISLE Host Server OS requirements](01_installation_host_server/host_server_system_specifications.md) prior to any installation.

**Please note:** There is a [Glossary](glossary.md) with relevant terms to help guide installation.

Please follow the columns below from left to right, to select:

1. `Desktop OS` is your laptop or desktop running a particular operating system `(OS)`

2. `ISLE Host Server Install instructions` is what you'll follow to host (_run_) ISLE. This may involve additional steps for installing a virtualized OS (CentOS or Ubuntu).

3. `Install ISLE Host Server Dependencies` is the software you may need to run ISLE on a `Host Platform` whether you use CentOS or Ubuntu as the ISLE Host Server.

4. `ISLE install instructions` _(for all OSes and Platform types)_

**Please note:**

* _Depending on the configuration you choose, you may have more or less instructions to follow._

* The operating systems displayed below are the minimum supported. Do not go lower than what is recommended.
